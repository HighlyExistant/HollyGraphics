# Graphics Has no Name
I am terrible with names so for now imma just call this graphics. I want to eventually make this it's own seperate project but since I have
my own math library inspired mainly from [cgmath](https://github.com/rustgd/cgmath) and
[glam-rs](https://github.com/bitshifter/glam-rs/), I decided to include it here for now as well, and might make a seperate repository for it at some point, since I dont want to just have a math project for linear algebra, but other facets of math as well since I love the subject.
